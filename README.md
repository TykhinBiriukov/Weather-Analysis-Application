# Weather Analysis Application

Weather Analysis Application is a console-based project that provides data analysis on weather forecasts for multiple cities. 
It shows usage of such libraries as: **pandas**, **seaborn** and **matplotlib** for data analysis and visualisation, **JSON/Database Parsing** to extract weather data from a database or JSON files.

Can be connected with my previous pet-project [**Weather Application**](https://github.com/TykhinBiriukov/Weather-Application) which collected data about forecasts in different cities and saved them into database.

## 🛠 Features

### 1. Weather Data Extraction
- The application allows users to extract weather data from a pre-filled SQLite database or JSON files.

### 2. Multi-City Weather Analysis
- Users can analyze weather parameters across multiple cities, comparing temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.

### 3. Single-City Weather Analysis
- The application also allows users to focus on a specific city and analyze weather over time.

### 4. Weather Parameter Analysis
- Analyze weather parameters like:
    - Temperature
    - Humidity
    - Wind Speed
    - Precipitation Volume
    - Dependency between humidity and precipitation volume
